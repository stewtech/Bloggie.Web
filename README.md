Bloggie.Web is a ASP.NET CORE MVC USING .NET 8 BLOG WEBSITE.
I have used Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition to build this along with MS SQL / SQL Server Management Studio version 19

I created domain models called Blogpost.cs and Tag.cs

I installed the Nuget Packages called Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools
